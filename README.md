# Streamlit_Blockchain_Ledger

## Background
  You’re a fintech engineer who’s working at one of the five largest banks in the world. You were recently promoted to act as the lead developer on their decentralized finance team. Your task is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.
  
## Libraries
  Must install: Pandas, hashlib, and streamlit
  
## Access
1. In the terminal, navigate to the project folder where it is stored.

2. In the terminal, run the Streamlit application by using `streamlit run pychain.py`.

3. Enter values for the sender, receiver, and amount, and then click the Add Block button. Do this several times to store several blocks in the ledger.

4. Verify the block contents and hashes in the Streamlit dropdown menu.

5. Test the blockchain validation process by pressing the "Validate Chain" button.
